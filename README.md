A JS-based program based on breaking a "code" set by the server. The code consists of 5 colored pegs (out of 8 possible colors) in random sequence. Similar to the Mastermind board game.

Launch server by entering `node code_breaker_server.js` in your terminal of choice. Launch code_breaker_client.html and play.
